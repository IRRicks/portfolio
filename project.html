      <h2>Summary:</h2>
      <p>In the ever-expanding cloud storage marketplace, something was missing.
        Users wanted the ability to collaborate with each other in real-time on projects.
        My goal was to take some of the best aspects of current cloud storage
      and organization applications and inject them with a sense of social networking.</p>

    <section class="discovery">
      <h2>Discovery Phase:</h2>
      <p>Before beginning the design process, I needed to gather information about how users felt about their current cloud application, the way they use them,
         and the features they would most like to see in future applications.</p>

        <p>Google has many products to offer its users through its Drive platform.
          They have built-in templates for surveys, documents, spreadsheets,
           and presentations. They also provide several tools for users to edit content with.</p>

      <h2>Information Architecture:</h2>
      <p>After gathering the initial research, I began working on how to structure of the content of the application. I started by creating users stories
        based off the data from the user survey responses,
        the competitive analysis and the user personas.
        I compiled a list of tasks that Trove users would want to complete and rated them from high to low priority.</p>

      <h2>Branding and Identity:</h2>
      <p>The concept for Trove came from wanting to convey a sense of security and stability to consumers. I started by thinking of the consumer’s content as actual treasure. This helped
         create the concept of the treasure chest.<br><br>Brand mood: New, bright, creative, clean and crisp.</p>
      <img src="images/trove/trovesketch.png" alt="trove sketches" class="sketch">
      <p>Once I knew I wanted to go in a treasure chest/nautical theme, I started to gather inspiration from around the web. Colors that are featured in the mood board (brown, orange, gold, blue
         and teal) were the foundational pieces for the finished app.</p>

      <h2>Usability Tests:</h2>
      <p>The first round of usability tests I ran provided valuable feedback about the overall functionality of the website. I conducted this test with three users.
         Users said they would like to see where/how to add new templates, and if there are any more ways to move files aside from deleting them.
         Also, a reviewer suggested combining the landing page, pricing into a single page. </p>

      <p>After the feedback from the usability tests, I was able to create high fidelity mockups of my final application.</p>

      <h2>Usability Tests:</h2>
      <p>The second round of usability tests provided insight into further improvements I could make to the application. I conducted this test with three users.
        From the feedback that I received, it seems like the idea and foundation behind the site have come together, but the fonts and icons used could be more consistent and user-friendly.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Preference Tests:</h2>
      <p>I conducted a preference test for three different elements in my design.
        The first element was the background color for the log-in screen.The feedback that I recieved was that users preferred a neutral background to a white background.
        Users also preferred a Cinzel Decorative/Muli font pairing.
        Finally, users preferred wider width CTA buttons on the login and sign up pages.</p>

      <img src="images/trove/surveygraph.png" alt="preference graph" class="graph">
        <p>83% of user preferred a the log-in screen with a neutral background compared to a log-in screen with a colored background.</p>
