      <h2>Summary:</h2>
      <p>In the ever-expanding cloud storage marketplace, something was missing. Users wanted the ability to collaborate with each other in real-time on projects. My goal was to take some of the best aspects of current cloud storage
      and organization applications and inject them with a sense of social networking.</p>
      <h2>Presenting Problem:</h2>
      <p>The client wanted to enter the cloud application market with an application that also provided user collaboration features. </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Discovery Phase:</h2>
      <p>Before beginning the design process, I needed to gather information about how users felt about their current cloud application, the way they use them, and the features they would most like to see in future applications.</p>

      <h2>Competitive Analysis:</h2>
        <p>Google Drive: Google has many products to offer its users through its Drive platform. They have built-in templates for surveys, documents, spreadsheets,  and presentations. They also provide several tools for users to edit content with.
        <br>Dropbox: Dropbox is available on multiple platforms, IOS, Android, and Office 365 applications. The application also has the option of administration control for business users.<br>Pinterest: Pinterest allows users to “Pin”
         images or ideas they find on websites to their boards. They also provide users with similar ideas to pins they have already chosen. Pinterest’s platform allows for endless scrolling of interests the user choses. </p>

      <h2>Branding and Identity:</h2>
      <p>The concept for Trove came from wanting to convey a sense of security and stability to consumers. We started by thinking of the consumer’s content as actual treasure. This helped
         create the concept of the treasure chest.<br>Brand mood: New, bright, creative, clean and crisp.</p>
      <img src="" alt="trove sketches"></img>
      <p>Once I knew I wanted to go in a treasure chest/nautical theme, I started to gather inspiration from around the web. Colors that are featured in the mood board (brown, orange, gold, blue
         and teal) were the foundational pieces for the finished app.</p>

      <h2>Usability Tests:</h2>
      <p>The first round of usability tests I ran provided valuable feedback about the overall functionality of the website. I conducted this test with three users.
         Users said they would like to see where/how to add new templates, and if there are any more ways to move files aside from deleting them.
         Also, a reviewer suggested combining the landing page, pricing into a single page. </p>

      <h2>Mockups:</h2>
      <p>After the feedback from the usability tests, I was able to create high fidelity mockups of my final application.</p>

      <h2>Usability Tests:</h2>
      <p>From the feedback that I received, it seems like the idea and foundation behind the site have come together, but the fonts and icons used could be more consistent and user-friendly.</p>
       </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Preference Tests:</h2>
      <p>I conducted a preference test for three different elements in my design.83% of user preferred a the log-in screen with a neutral background compared to a log-in screen with a colored background.</p>
